      <p className='Abt'>This list of the 100 most common vocabulary words in<br/> English can be used as a reference for beginner English students.<br/> It's a good idea to master these words fully before trying to move on to less common words, <br/>since this is the vocabulary you will encounter most often. These are some of the first words that native<br/> English speaking children learn how to spell.<br/> You can also make sure that you not only recognize these words and know how to pronounce them, but <br/>that you can also spell them correctly. Mistakes in spelling these short, common words are<br/> more significant than mistakes spelling more complicated words you may learn later on.</p>
